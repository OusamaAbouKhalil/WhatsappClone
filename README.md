An app built with Firebase can have a wide range of features, including real-time messaging, cloud storage, and user authentication. Firebase's real-time database feature can be used to store and retrieve data in real-time, making it ideal for messaging apps. This allows users to see messages as they are sent and received, providing a seamless messaging experience.

In addition, Firebase's cloud storage feature can be used to enable users to share files with each other, such as photos, videos, and documents. This feature can be particularly useful for businesses and organizations that need to share files securely and easily.

Firebase's user authentication feature can also be used to enable users to sign up and log in securely to the app. This helps to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access the app's features.
